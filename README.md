ALSO CHECKOUT: https://github.com/BeyondEarthRP/BERP-FiveM-Easy-Install

The above link is the installer. This repository is used by BERP Server and any BERP Flavored deployment created via the FiveM-Easy-Install scripts.

Other than that, this is just currated list of FiveM plugins, all forked to be maintained by Beyond Earth and BERP team.  The goal of BERP servers is 
to be 100% controller friendly.  Tested using an XBox controller on windows 10 (that is how I play).  There are some keyboard only buttons... but 
they are not a game changer.  It does make it easier to have a keyboard infront of you though... which I always do.... so just keep that in mind.

If you'd like to be involved or discuss, you can joing me on discord.
